# Thesis

This is my thesis that i made in Unity for my university.Its a 2d Survival game of a sort.
The whole game is made by me witch includes music ,animations,2d models,backgound and and so on. 
You have AWSD movement + "F" for equip screen + "C" for crafting screen + "I" for inventory screen.
This is the dev version so some items are going to fall from the sky at the start of the game.
